/* Write two functions:
 A range function that has two parameters: from and to, returning an array of numbers between the two params, inclusive.
 So range(1, 10) should result in: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

 A sum function, which has a single parameter: arr, an array of numbers
 Return the sum of these numbers

 As a bonus, chain these two functions, so that sum(range(1,2)) === 3
